 <p>What I expected to learn in this class was how to use code to create games that I would like to play, but what we actually learned was more than just games, it was learning on how to create
 different types of cool situations on how to make stories, weird and funny. Also, to create useful everyday apps everyone could use.
 I think this class was the best class I've had in a long time, I had fun and learned something at the same time.
 My favorite project we did in this class was the unity Roll a Ball project because I was able to create something that I would play and it was addicting to try and beat your own score.
 What I might do with the information I learned in this class is to maybe try to later create the best game that everyone can use and would like to play all the time.</p>
